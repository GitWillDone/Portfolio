# Will Dunn Portfolio

For those that are interested in what I've accomplished during my programming endeavor.
The directories listed are meant to show packages that I felt were meaningful
during my programming career and are able to be shown (non-proprietary).

Note: files that reference those larger than what can be uploaded to github
are used to illustrate my coding technique (some projects in Data Analytics).
If one tries to compile these, they might comes across FileNotFound Exceptions
or the programming language equivalent. The same can be said with credentials.
